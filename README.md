The objective of this project is to set up ssh config such that I could ssh to my public ip lab without having to verify my public ip.

Motivation
I have to often login to my home linux server to check one or other thing, however I am mostly in corporate VPN (which updates my routes) and often I cannot ssh to my home server on LAN. Thus, I opened my home server to public internet (only for ssh). Another problem is that I don't have static IP provided by my ISP so I need to manually check my public IP before I could ssh to my server. Now this will take 2 mins but who wants to spend 2 mins if they really want to spend 2 hours to build this script and also learn something in the process :)
